      <p>
        The Brigade Project Index is a collaborative project involving core
        contributorts from across many brigades. We design, develop, and
        maintain a set of tools and practices for mapping out all the work being
        done on projects across the entire global network of civic hacking
        organizations and Code for America brigades. Our core goal is to publish
        a rich and constantly-updated database of projects that any number of
        network projects can use as a data source to help us get better
        connected.
